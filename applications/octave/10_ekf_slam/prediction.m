#               coming from the simulator
#               of these we are interested only in the offset

#  mu: is the mean of (x,y,theta, l1, l2, ..., lm), i.e. the previously estimated robot pose
#      and the m landmark positions
#  sigma: is the mean of the previously estimated robot pose and landmark positions ((3+m)x(3+m) matrix)

# outputs 
# [mu, sigma] are mean and covariance of the estimate after transition
